Question 1a

# Load the data
load("/Users/ari3/Downloads/ACS_2021_couples (3).RData")

# Filter for males in acs_subgroup1 (25-55 age range, Male, not receiving food stamps)
acs_subgroup1 <- acs2021_couples %>% 
  filter((AGE >= 25) & (AGE <= 55) & (SEX == "Male") & (FOODSTMP == 2))

# Convert EDUC to an ordered factor, then to numeric

  mutate(
    EDUC_numeric = as.numeric(factor(
      EDUC,
      levels = c(

    )),
    h_educ = as.factor(h_educ)  # Convert h_educ to factor
  )

# Fit the linear model with the new numeric education variable
model_1 <- lm(EDUC_numeric ~ AGE + h_educ, data = acs_subgroup1)
summary(model_1)

# Create a range of ages for prediction (25-55 years as in the subset)
age_range <- seq(min(acs_subgroup1$AGE, na.rm = TRUE), max(acs_subgroup1$AGE, na.rm = TRUE), length.out = 100)

# Use the most common level of h_educ for prediction
common_h_educ <- as.factor(names(sort(table(acs_subgroup1$h_educ), decreasing = TRUE)[1]))
prediction_data <- data.frame(
  AGE = age_range,
  h_educ = common_h_educ  # use most common level of h_educ as a factor for predictions

# Generate predictions using the linear model

# t-stat: 14.560 
#p-value: <2e-16
#Conf int: (-3.896278e-01) , (-3.105302e-01)
#Conclusion:At the 90% confidence level, we reject the null hypothesis, indicating a significant relationship between household income levels and age differences in couples. Specifically, as the income midpoint increases, the age difference between partners decreases, suggesting a negative relationship. This supports the hypothesis that different age groups in the labor force exhibit significant differences in age gaps compared to those not in the labor force.

Question 1b
```{r}
# Part b: Hypothesis Test on Income Levels and Age Differences in Couples

# Hypothesis Test
# Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no relationship between income levels and age differences in couples.
# Alternative Hypothesis (H1): There is a relationship between income levels and age differences in couples, with labor force status influencing age gaps.

# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)

# Load the dataset
load("/Users/ari3/Downloads/ACS_2021_couples (3).RData")

# Calculate age difference between couples

  mutate(age_diff = AGE - h_age)

# Define income midpoint categories to simplify income analysis
acs_subgroup <- acs2021_couples %>%
  mutate(income_midpoint = case_when(

    HHINCOME >= 150000 & HHINCOME < 200000 ~ 175000,
    HHINCOME >= 200000 ~ 225000,

# Filter the subgroup for individuals aged 25-85 who are active in the labor force
acs_subgroup1 <- acs_subgroup %>%
  filter(AGE >= 25 & AGE <= 85, WKSWORK2 > 4, UHRSWORK >= 35)

# Fit a linear model to examine the effect of income midpoint on age difference
model_1 <- lm(age_diff ~ income_midpoint, data = acs_subgroup1)
summary(model_1)
confint(model_1, level = 0.90)

#Output summary statistics
#Check the coefficient for `income_midpoint` to see if it’s significantly different from zero. If the confidence interval does not include zero, we reject the null hypothesis at the 90% confidence level.

# t-stat: 14.560 
#p-value: <2e-16
#Conf int: (-3.896278e-01) , (-3.105302e-01)

# Conclusion:
#At the 90% confidence level, examine if the confidence interval for `income_midpoint` excludes zero. A significant p-value and confidence interval excluding zero suggest that income influences age differences among couples in the labor force. Since the p-value is extremely small, the t-statistic is large, and the confidence interval does not contain zero, we reject the null hypothesis. This means we have strong evidence to conclude that women do not use food stamps more than men.
```


Question 1c: Results
```{r}
#Null Hypothesis: Women use food stamps at a higher rate than men.
#H₀: w > m

#Alternative Hypothesis: Women do not use food stamps more than men.
#H₁: w ≤ m


#this is a left tailed test 

#confidence interval is 95% 

#z-score is -1.645

#the t stat must be less than or equal to the z score. 

#2e-16 is greater than -1.645. 

#P-vaLue: < 2e-16 
#T-stat: -9.796
#Confint: [-0.3972, -0.3029]

#Conclusion: Since the t-stat is greater than the z-score, we must fail to reject the null hypothesis. Thus, women do use more food stamps than men.
```


Question 2
```{r}
For my topic, I will be diving into the the influence that social media advertising has on consumer spending behavior among young adults.

#Article One: "Americans’ Social Media Use" https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2024/01/31/americans-social-media-use/
This article offers insights into the social media usage patterns across different age groups. The reports goes into detail of different platform preferences and engagement levels of different individuals

#Article Two: "From Social to Sale: The Effects of Firm-Generated Content in Social Media on Customer Behavior "https://www.jstor.org/stable/43785256
This article gives insight into the affect of social media on consumer behavior by examining three key customer metrics: spending, cross-buying, and customer profitability.
